- 2025-05-10 - https://fireborn.mataroa.blog/ - Detailed series about deficiencies in the Linux ecosystem from the perspective of a blind software dev.
- 2025-06-18 - https://acidiclight.dev/blog/accessibility-does-not-feel-accessible/ - Low vision dev talking about difficulty using AccessKit from C# (they made their own bindings). May be fruitful to introduce to Matt Campbell, I think he thinks there are more resources behind it than there are.
- 2025-11-15 - https://www.semicomplete.com/blog/xdotool-and-exploring-wayland-fragmentation/ - Reasonably concise list of investigations the author of xdotool has gone through when considering a Wayland port.
