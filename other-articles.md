This page is just somewhere to put links of potential relevance that I haven't fully processed:

- 2025-05-10 - https://fireborn.mataroa.blog/ - Detailed series about deficiencies in the Linux ecosystem from the perspective of a blind software dev.
- 2025-06-18 - https://acidiclight.dev/blog/accessibility-does-not-feel-accessible/ - Low vision dev talking about difficulty using AccessKit from C# (they made their own bindings). May be fruitful to introduce to Matt Campbell, I think he thinks there are more resources behind it than there are.
